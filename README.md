# Stochastic_Simulation_a3
Eperiment with the ability of different opitimization algorithms (Hill climbing and Simulated Annealing) to reverse engineer the parameters of the Lotka-Volterra equations based on a given time series.

Further experiments were done into the effects of different objective functions and the effect of different types of data reduction and their resulting critical amount of data points per time series.

Run.py contains the code to run the experiments.
Functions.py contains the different functions which run the Simulated Annealing, Hill climbing, experiments and helper functions
